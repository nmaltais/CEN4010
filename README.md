# Vision Statement
Our objective is to design and implement a webÂ­based application that will use Image Recognition to facilitate and maintain visual timesheet records. The system will allow employees who are at a workstation with a front facing camera to time in and time out work hours accurately. Our reasoning for using facial image recognition with the camera is for accountability of hours worked through two factor authentication (password & image).
